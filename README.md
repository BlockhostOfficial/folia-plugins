# Folia Plugins Directory

## About This List
This repository is different from other Folia plugin lists, because it's not meant for self-promoting QuickShop/TNE-made plugins, but rather what the list is designed for, providing an unbiased resource to server owners.
All plugins here are listed equally, with **no paid placement, endorsements, or favoritism**.  
The goal is to help **server owners quickly find compatible plugins** without bias toward the authors.

## ü§ù Closing Note
This list is **community-driven** and aims to be an **unbiased, factual resource**.  
We do not promote specific plugins for personal gain like other folia lists do, and every project is listed based on **its Folia compatibility status**, not on sponsorships or affiliations.
