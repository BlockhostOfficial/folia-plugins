# Folia Plugins
[Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) is a brand new server software made by the team behind [PaperMC](https://papermc.io), a SpigotMC fork. Folia is a new multithreaded version of PaperMC. With Folia you can handle way more players than you normally could. It requires powerful hardware and the plugins must be updated to support Folia.
